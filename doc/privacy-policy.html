        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p>Welcome to Cupid, an AI-powered conversation analysis application that prioritizes your privacy and data security. We are committed to protecting your personal information and being transparent about how your data is used. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle your data and your rights in relation to your personal information.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We do not collect or store any personal information from users. All conversations analyzed by the Cupid app are processed in real-time on your device.</p>

        <h2>2. Use of Gemini API</h2>
        <p>The Cupid app uses the <span class="highlight">Gemini API</span> to perform conversation analysis. This API processes your conversations locally on your device to provide insights and analysis.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Messages and conversations analyzed are not transmitted to any external servers or databases.</li>
            <li>All analyses are performed <span class="highlight">locally</span> on your device, ensuring that your messages remain private and secure.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. No Data Storage</h2>
        <p>We do not store any of your messages or conversation data on our servers. Cupid is designed to operate without server-side storage of user interactions.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Once the conversation analysis is complete, the data is not saved or retained by the app or on any server.</li>
            <li>Your privacy is fully respected, and we ensure that no data is stored, shared, or sold to third parties.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. User Control and Security</h2>
        <p>You have complete control over your data and analysis. As the analysis is performed locally on your device, you can be assured that:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Your conversations are processed in real-time without any risk of external breaches.</li>
            <li>The app does not access any additional data or services outside of the Gemini API for analysis.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Updates to this Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the app, technology, or legal requirements. You will be notified of any changes via the app or through email if applicable.</p>

        <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or concerns about our Privacy Policy or the use of your data, please feel free to contact us at <span class="highlight">gokulskrishnan74@gmail.com</span>.</p>
